FIXED: 30-Second Cooldown Between Strikes

WHAT WAS WRONG:
- Extension was checking every 5 seconds
- Once you hit 30 seconds on an unproductive tab, EVERY check added a strike
- Could get multiple strikes in quick succession

WHAT I FIXED:
1. Added lastStrikeTime variable to track when we last added a strike
2. Added 30-second cooldown check before allowing another strike
3. Reset lastStrikeTime when monitoring starts

NOW IT WILL:
- Still check every 5 seconds (quick status updates)
- But only add ONE strike per 30 seconds maximum
- Reset the cooldown timer correctly

RELOAD THE EXTENSION AND TEST!
