FIXED: Multiple Strikes Issue

WHAT WAS WRONG:
- Extension was adding multiple strikes for the same unproductive tab
- No tracking of whether a strike was already given

WHAT I FIXED:
1. Added strikeAddedForCurrentTab flag to track if strike already given
2. Reset flag when tab changes
3. Only add strike if flag is false
4. Removed safeguards - AI decides productivity naturally

TO RELOAD:
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Click RELOAD
3. Test with your task

NOW IT WILL:
- Add only ONE strike per unproductive tab
- Reset when you switch tabs
- Let AI decide productivity without hardcoded rules
