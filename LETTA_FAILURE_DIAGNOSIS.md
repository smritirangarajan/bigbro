LETTA API FAILURE DIAGNOSIS

EXACT FAILURE POINT:
1. Code attempts to fetch from: https://api.letta.ai/v1/agents/{agent_id}/messages
2. DNS lookup fails: "Could not resolve host: api.letta.ai"
3. Result: "TypeError: Failed to fetch"

WHAT THIS MEANS:
- The domain api.letta.ai does NOT exist or is not publicly accessible
- This is NOT a code issue
- This is NOT an API key issue
- This is a network/infrastructure issue

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
1. Wrong API domain - maybe it's letta.io or letta.com?
2. Letta Cloud is region-locked or requires VPN
3. Letta Cloud hasn't been fully deployed yet
4. DNS propagation issue (unlikely for this long)

WHAT TO CHECK:
1. Check Letta documentation for correct API base URL
2. Check if Letta requires special setup for API access
3. Check if Letta has a different API endpoint
4. Check if you need to use the Letta SDK instead of direct API calls
5. Check if there's a different base URL like api.letta.io or letta.api

SOLUTION:
- For now, skip Letta and use Claude (which is working)
- Contact Letta support to get correct API endpoint
- Or check Letta documentation for correct API domain
