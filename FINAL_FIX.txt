FIXES APPLIED:

1. COOLDOWN DEBUGGING:
   - Added detailed logs showing last strike time
   - Shows time since last strike
   - Shows if cooldown is active and how much time is left

2. ALERT FIX:
   - Added fallback using chrome.scripting.executeScript
   - If content script fails, it will inject an alert function directly
   - You should now see alerts when strikes are added

CRITICAL: RELOAD THE EXTENSION!

The code has changed - you MUST reload:
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Click RELOAD on your extension
3. Check the console - you should see:
   - ‚è∞ Cooldown check logs
   - üì§ Alert injection logs
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è Cooldown active messages

Let me know what you see in the console!
