REMOVED: Start Recording Button

WHAT WAS REMOVED:
1. startVisualRecording() function
2. stopVisualRecording() function  
3. analyzeCurrentScreen() function
4. Message handlers for startRecording/stopRecording
5. Unused recordingInterval and recordingStream variables

WHY IT'S NOT NEEDED:
- Screenshots are already captured automatically during productivity checks
- Each checkTask() call captures a screenshot and sends it to Claude
- The "start recording" button was doing nothing useful

HOW IT WORKS NOW:
1. User sets task and clicks "Start Monitoring"
2. Extension checks every 5 seconds
3. On each check, it automatically captures a screenshot
4. Screenshot is sent to Claude Vision for analysis
5. Claude analyzes the actual screen content

NO SEPARATE RECORDING STEP NEEDED!
