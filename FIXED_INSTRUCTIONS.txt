EXTENSION FIXED - RELOAD NOW!

The issue was a syntax error: duplicate declaration of 'timeOnTab' variable.

NOW DO THIS:
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Click the circular RELOAD button on your extension
3. Click "Inspect views: background page" 
4. Check the Console tab

YOU SHOULD NOW SEE:
✅ Background service worker loaded
✅ Using Letta agent ID: agent-90ee73f6-e688-470d-977a-7f0e8f31c783
✅ Periodic logs appearing every 5 seconds

The "Checking..." status should now update to either "Productive" or "Unproductive"
